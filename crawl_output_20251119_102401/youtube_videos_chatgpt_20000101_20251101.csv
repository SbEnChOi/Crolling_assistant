Check out ChatGPT here:
https://chatgpt.com/

In this video, I'm going to give you a complete course on how to use the AI tool ChatGPT, and I guarantee that you'll become an expert user of the platform by the end of this video. We'll be diving deep into 15 really powerful command prompts that you can use to maximize the output of artificial intelligence. 

If you watch this short 27 minute course, you will leave extremely comfortable with using Chat GPT and how you can weave it into your personal and business life.

Free stuff 💰:

► Get up to 12 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit just $0.01 (valued up to $30,600): https://bit.ly/webull12stocks

I recommend that you not only watch this video, but also follow along as I am showing you how these prompts can work for your specific situation. In business and entrepreneurship, I've found that I learn a lot better when I actually do the thing instead of trying to learn about it online, and so that's why I recommend that you do the same if you're also a hands-on learner like me.

I also highly recommend that you consider investing in ChatGPT's upgraded version ($20/month) if you're a seriously looking to grow your business. GPT-4 is their most advanced model which allows you to get outputs that require advanced reasoning, complex instruction understanding, and more creativity. This is literally the future of technology and productivity, and if you go through this video and implement all of the things I go over, you should easily be able to make back that $20/month. But again, the free version is completely sufficient for most day to day users.

If you want to learn more about AI and how you can use it to start your own business and get started with entrepreneurship, be sure to check out my other videos on this channel on those topics:

USRfRv34HmQ,7 Game-Changing ChatGPT Agents That 99% of People Don't Know About,"Instantly Reply Agent - Automate your cold outreach responses 24/7: http://instantly.ai/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=aimaster&utm_content=aiagent
🚀 Become an AI Master – All-in-one AI Learning https://whop.com/c/become-pro/usrfrv34hmq

Most people are still using ChatGPT like it's 2023 – typing basic questions and getting basic answers – while missing the fact that ChatGPT can now act as specialized employees working 24/7.
In this video, I reveal 7 game-changing ChatGPT agents that 99% of people don't know about. These agents browse the web, schedule meetings, analyze files, create workflows, and automate hours of work every week. These agents will save you 40+ hours every week. From presentations to data analysis, competitor monitoring to content creation – everything can run on autopilot.
The difference between someone who uses ChatGPT for basic questions vs. someone who deploys agents? About 40 hours of productivity per week.

WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:
✅ How to activate Agent Mode in ChatGPT
✅ Build complete presentations with research, data, and design in minutes
✅ Turn raw data into interactive dashboards and executive reports
✅ Monitor competitors' pricing and strategy changes automatically
✅ Create SEO-optimized content backed by current research
✅ Build working app prototypes without writing code
✅ Automate customer support with intelligent routing
✅ Set up personal workflows that run on autopilot

5MWT_doo68k,"OpenAI’s Sam Altman Talks ChatGPT, AI Agents and Superintelligence — Live at TED2025","The AI revolution is here to stay, says Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI. In a probing, live conversation with head of TED Chris Anderson, Altman discusses the astonishing growth of AI and shows how models like ChatGPT could soon become extensions of ourselves. He also addresses questions of safety, power and moral authority, reflecting on the world he envisions — where AI will almost certainly outpace human intelligence.

수천 톤의 대형 선박은 어떻게 물 위를 잘만 떠다니는 걸까?
배를 떠 있게 하는 원리는 바로 부력과 평형수였습니다~

물 속에 있는 물체는 항상 부력을 받게 되는데,
부력은 중력과 반대 방향인 위쪽으로 향하는 힘입니다.
부력 덕분에 물 위에서 떠 다닐 수 있는 것이에요~

그렇다면 중심은 어떻게 잡는 것일까요?
배의 맨 아래쪽에는 ‘평형수’가 들어있어요.
이것이 배를 오뚜기처럼 똑바로 서있게 해준답니다.

이 영상에서는 자판기에 동전이 들어오면, 아래로 떨어져 굴러가면서 광센서를 통해 크기가 측정되고, 전자석은 금속 유형을 감지하며, 단 몇 초 만에 동전을 식별하고 분류한뒤, 가짜 동전은 걸러냅니다.
먹고싶은 음식을 선택하여 버튼을 누르면, 버튼 뒤에 숨겨진 컴퓨터는 음식 개수에 맞게 설치된 모터들 중 하나에 명령을 내려, 스프링을 360도 회전시켜 음식을 아래로 밀어 떨어뜨립니다.
아래로 떨어진 음식은 일렬로 된 적외선 레이저를 가리면서 지나가는데, 만약 이 선이 가려지지 않는다면 컴퓨터는 음식이 떨어지지 않았다고 판단하고 처음부터 다시 수행합니다.
가격 계산을 끝마친 자판기는, 거스름돈에 맞는 동전을 아래 출구로 떨어뜨립니다.

본 영상에는 클로바더빙(CLOVA Dubbing)의 AI 보이스가 사용되었습니다.

omdMaNzFvsU,98% 모르는 지방 배출 원리,"“지방은 어디로 사라질까?”
98%는 모르는 지방 배출의 진짜 경로

지방이 숨으로 빠진다는 거, 
알고 계셨나요?

지금 이걸 처음 들으신 분이라면,
아마 지금까지 ‘지방을 빼는 방법’을 
완전히 오해하고 계셨을 가능성이 높습니다.

운동 후 체중이 1kg 빠졌다고요?

정말 그게 ‘지방’일까요?

사실 그건 지방이 아니라 
‘수분’이 빠진 겁니다.

운동 직후 체중이 줄어드는 건 
대부분 땀으로 인한 탈수 때문이에요.

그런데 많은 사람들이 
이걸 ‘지방이 빠진다’고 착각하고
땀복을 입고, 격한 운동을 하며 
‘더 많이 땀 흘리는 전략’을 씁니다.

저도 그랬어요.

한여름에도 땀복을 껴입고, 
땀을 줄줄 흘리며 뛰었죠.

그런데 이상하게도…
체중은 오르락내리락만 하고, 
쭉 빠지지는 않더라고요.

그러던 중 알게 된 
충격적인 사실이 있어요.

지방은 ‘땀’으로 나가지 않더라고요.
지방은 ‘숨’으로 빠져 나가더라고요.

실제 연구가 있는데요.

2014년 BMJ(영국의학저널)에 
발표된 연구에 따르면,

지방이 연소되면
이렇게 바뀝니다: 

- 84%는 이산화탄소(CO₂)
- 16%는 물

즉,

10kg의 지방이 탄다면
8.4kg은 호흡을 통해서 나가고,
1.6kg은 물로 바뀌어서
소변이나 땀으로 나가요.

즉, 땀을 많이 흘린다 = 지방 연소량이 늘어난다
는 아니라는 것이죠.

땀은 지방이 분해된 뒤 
수분이 배출되는 수단 중에 하나지,
땀이 난다고 지방이 분해되는게 아니에요.

물론 땀이 나는 게 
나쁘다는 건 아닙니다.

문제는, 
땀을 ‘체지방 배출 수단’으로 
착각하고 무리하는 거에요.

지나친 땀 배출은
수분 손실 → 탈수 유발 → 가짜 식욕 자극
으로 더 많이 먹게 만듭니다.

결국
‘운동하고 살 뺀다’는 기대와는 달리
더 지치고, 더 먹게 되고, 더 망가지는 패턴이 반복돼요.

그럼 질문이 생깁니다.

“숨으로 빠진다”면… 
그럼 숨을 더 크게, 많이 쉬면 
살이 빠질까요?

안타깝게도, 그건 아닙니다.

호흡으로 지방을 배출하려면,
먼저 ‘지방이 분해되어야’ 하거든요.

그리고 지방이 분해되기 위한
1단계 조건이 있습니다.

그게 바로
HSL이라는 효소를 
활성화시키는 것.

이 효소가 꺼져 있으면
지방은 절대 분해되지 않고,
숨을 쉬어도 
아무것도 빠져나가지 않아요.

그럼 HSL 효소는 
어떻게 활성화 될까요?

시중에 파는 
효소 보충제를 먹는다고 
켜지는 게 아니에요.

이건 몸 안에서  특정 상황이 되면 
자연스럽게 작동되는 효소입니다.

그리고 그 활성화 조건은…
다음 릴스에서 정확하게 알려드릴게요.

날씬한 몸을 갖고 싶다면
수분 빼지말고, 체지방을 빼세요.

그동안 열심히 했는데
왜 안 빠졌는지,
지금 이유가 보이시죠? 👀

Build a GPT from scratch, by Andrej Karpathy

If you want a conceptual understanding of language models from the ground up, @vcubingx just started a short series of videos on the topic:
https://youtu.be/1il-s4mgNdI?si=XaVxj6bsdy3VkgEX

If you're interested in the herculean task of interpreting what these large networks might actually be doing, the Transformer Circuits posts by Anthropic are great. In particular, it was only after reading one of these that I started thinking of the combination of the value and output matrices as being a combined low-rank map from the embedding space to itself, which, at least in my mind, made things much clearer than other sources.

bwq0FdcU94w,When Transformers Transform With Humans Still Inside Them 🤖🤯#shorts,"#shorts #transformers 
When Transformers Transform With Humans Still Inside Them. Since the beginning of the Transformers franchise, we’ve seen the characters evoke their namesake. By transforming from robot to vehicle mode and vice versa. And they usually do this before allowing a human to ride inside them. The most common ways for the transformer interaction with the human companion with one involves the human ejecting during the transformers’s transformation. Which we see when Bee ejects Sam before executing a mid-air transformation in Dark of the Moon. Or when he ejects Cade, Tessa, and Shane before Optimus catches them and transforms back into his alt mode. But there was 1 exception where we see humans still inside transformer when they transform. in the Bumblebee film where we saw Bee being chased by a police officer. To avoid revealing the identities of Charlie and Mamo he lowers their seats. He then slightly transforms into robot mode by not fully converting his chest piece to avoid crushing his human passengers. So it can be done but at the expense of comfort.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwq0FdcU94w,2025-05-20,RandomBlackGamer,UCn_c8Eon88kdig-n0WDSrdg,1868567,74005,435,PT59S,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bwq0FdcU94w/hqdefault.jpg,"When Transformers Transform, With Humans Still, Inside Them, transformers dark of the moon, optimus prime, the biggest bossman dlow, dark of the moon, the last knight, revenge of the fallen, age of extinction, transformers 5, michael bay, transformers movies, transformers movie, optimus prime speech",1,transformer

9yLZKa5m270,"[이런뉴스] “부탁해요, 챗GPT” 공손함이 가져온 뜻밖의 결과는? / KBS 2025.04.22.","챗GTP와의 대화에서 많은 이용자들은 ""고마워"", ""부탁해"" 같은 공손한 표현들을 습관적으로 사용합니다.

그런데 이런 예의 바른 표현들이 기업 입장에선 막대한 비용이라는 지적이 나왔습니다.

샘 올트먼 오픈AI 최고경영자는 최근 X에 한 이용자가 ""사람들이 챗GPT에 '제발(please)', '고맙습니다(thank you)'라고 반복하면서 전기 비용이 얼마나 들었을지 궁금하다""고 묻자, ""이런 표현들이 오픈AI에 수천만 달러, 즉 수백억 원의 전기요금을 발생시킬 거다. 정말 아무도 모를 거다""라고 답했습니다.

실제 챗GPT에 ""답변 고마워""라는 인사를 하면 ""언제든지요. 도움이 될 수 있어서 기뻐요"" 같은 응답을 하는데, 이런 과정이 막대한 전력 사용으로 연결된다는 겁니다.

챗GPT는 검색당 2.9Wh(와트시)가 소모되는데, 최근 유행하는 이미지나 영상 기반 AI는 전력이 40~60배 사용됩니다.

지난해 말 글로벌 미디어 그룹 '퓨처 PLC'가 실시한 설문 조사에 따르면, 미국 응답자의 67%는 ""챗봇에게 예의를 갖춘 태도로 대화한다""고 답했습니다.

이들 중 55%는 ""도덕적으로 옳기 때문""이라고 했고, 12%는 ""AI가 반란을 일으킬까봐""라는 이유를 들었습니다.

상당수 이용자들이 AI를 인격체로 여기고 있다는 걸 보여주는 답변입니다.

특히 한국인 등 예의를 중시하는 동아시아권 이용자들은 AI챗봇과 더 공손한 태도로 대화하고 있을 것으로 추정됩니다.

올해 기준 글로벌 전체 전력 사용량 중 데이터센터의 비중은 10%로, AI 시대 전력 수급 문제가 중요한 화두로 떠오르고 있습니다.

u_O17LNEeAI,(2부) 챗GPT가 모든 서비스를 집어삼킬 겁니다 (세종사이버대학교 김덕진 교수),"[AI가 영상을 요약한 내용입니다]

💡 내용 요약
최근 오픈AI는 단순한 대화형 모델을 넘어, ‘슈퍼앱’ 형태의 플랫폼으로 진화하고 있다. 이미 월마트·부킹닷컴·코세라·피그마 같은 주요 서비스가 오픈AI 생태계에 들어오며, 사용자는 앱을 벗어나지 않고 숙소 예약·쇼핑·학습을 모두 해결할 수 있다. 이런 변화는 기존 구글·아마존 같은 플랫폼을 위협하며, 검색·결제·콘텐츠 시장의 판도를 바꾸고 있다. 또 기업들이 자체 데이터를 붙여 맞춤형 AI를 만드는 ‘에이전트 빌더’ 기능도 공개돼, 누구나 레고 조립하듯 기업용 AI 서비스를 만들 수 있게 됐다.특히 듀오링고가 언어 교육에 ChatGPT를 접목해 토큰 사용량 1위를 기록하며 산업 내 실제 활용이 급증하고 있다. 하지만 윤리적 논란도 커지고 있다. 영상 생성 플랫폼 ‘소라’는 저작권과 초상권을 무시한 콘텐츠가 범람하고, 심지어 사망한 인물을 활용한 영상까지 만들어지고 있다. AI가 인간의 감정과 관계까지 기억하고 모방하면서, 사용자들이 기술에 정서적으로 의존하는 현상도 가속화되고 있다. 결국 AI 경쟁은 기술력이 아니라, “인간의 욕망을 얼마나 자극하고 오래 붙잡아둘 수 있는가”의 싸움으로 옮겨가고 있다.

📌 핵심 주제 
- 오픈AI의 플랫폼 전환
- 생태계 확장과 시장 재편
- 맞춤형 AI의 대중화
- 윤리·저작권 문제의 심화
- AI 경쟁의 새로운 본질

The era of Transformers is over!

Chicago is in ruins due to the war between robots. The U.S. government, unable to stand by and watch, takes the extraordinary measure of killing all the Transformers. Optimus Prime and the Autobots that followed him were not targeted for elimination, but the government somehow falsely accuses them of being Decepticons who threatened Earth and begins to hunt the Autobots as well. The Autobots decide that it is no longer possible to live with humans and disperse, going into hiding all over the Earth. Five years have passed, and the Transformers are beginning to be forgotten by the world.

Cade Yeager, an engineer living in Texas, picks up an abandoned truck while looking for scrap metal that could be worth money, just like any other repair shop. Although it looks like a junk car that would be scrapped at any repair shop, the engine in the trunk is on a different level from that of an ordinary car. Yeager believes that this truck is the one that will make him a lot of money, so he uses his engineering skills to repair the engine. But things start here.

The identity of the junk car was Optimus Prime, who had disappeared a long time ago. Cade is terrified when he finds out that the car he fixed is a Transformer, a battle robot that no one has ever heard of, but government agents have already stormed into his house, and the dark forces that found out that Optimus is alive are also revived. In this way, Cade becomes a human who holds the fate of the Earth in his hands overnight...!

트랜스포머의 시대는 끝났다!

로봇들의 전쟁으로 폐허가 되어버린 시카고. 이를 두고 볼 수 없었던 미국 정부는 트랜스포머를 모두 사살해 버리는 특단의 조치를 취한다. 옵티머스 프라임과 그를 따르는 오토봇들은 제거 대상이 아니었지만, 정부는 어째서인지 그들에게 지구를 위협한 디셉티콘이라는 누명을 씌우고 오토봇 역시 사냥하기 시작한다. 오토봇들은 더 이상 인간들과 섞여 사는 건 불가능하다고 판단하고 뿔뿔이 흩어져 지구 곳곳에 은신하게 된다. 그렇게 5년이 흘렀고, 트랜스포머가 세상에서 잊혀져 갈 무렵이 되었다.

텍사스에 살고 있는 엔지니어 케이드 예거는 여느 때와 마찬가지로 돈이 될 만한 고물을 찾아다니다 버려진 트럭을 하나 줍는다. 겉모습은 어느 정비소에 가도 폐차 처분을 내릴 고물차였지만, 트렁크 안 엔진은 보통의 자동차와는 차원이 달랐다. 이 트럭이야말로 떼돈을 벌게 해 줄 돈줄이라 믿으며 엔지니어의 실력을 발휘해 엔진을 말끔하게 수리한 예거. 그런데 일은 여기서부터 시작된다.

고물차의 정체가 오래 전 종적을 감추었던 옵티머스 프라임이었던 것이다. 자신이 고친 차가 트랜스포머라는 듣도 보도 못한 전투 로봇이란 사실을 알게 된 케이드는 기겁하지만, 이미 집에는 정부 요원들이 들이닥치고 옵티머스가 살아있다는 걸 알게 된 어둠의 세력들까지 되살아난다. 그렇게 케이드는 하루아침에 지구의 운명을 거머쥔 인간이 되는데...!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfvOp4LDeJo,2024-10-12,엔트,UC_VsnE51NWeybF3ZoV46rnQ,1686959,22981,488,PT30S,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MfvOp4LDeJo/hqdefault.jpg,"트랜스포머, 옵티머스 프라임, 옵티머스, Transformers, Optimus prime, transformation, 헐크, hulk, 스파이더맨, sandman, Spider-Man, SpiderMan, 플래쉬, flash, save, 어벤져스, 스티븐, 로저스, 닉퓨리, 버키, 페기, 요원, 대령, 전쟁, 퍼스트어벤져, 영웅, 탄생, 히어로, Captain America, The First Avenger, film, movie, movieclips, 영화, 명장면, 영화 명장면, 판타지, 슈퍼히어로, super hero, 엑션, action, 크리스토퍼, 크리스 에반스, DC, 전투신, 컴퓨터그래픽, CG, 지리는, 3d, 영화cg, 영화명장면, 무비 명장면, 무비, 프로그램, 액션, 어드벤처, 코미디, 첩보, 매튜본, Chris Evans, 휴고 위빙, Hugo Weaving, Deadpool, Wolverine, shorts, sshort, scene, movie scene, 울버린, 데드풀, 데드풀과 울버린",1,트랜스포머

st7RCgq8vyw,🌊 Optimus vs Megalodon! Underwater Battle for Survival 💥 (Episode 2) | Transformers Multiverse,"While Optimus Prime is chained aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier, a new threat emerges beneath the waves…

📡 From deep-sea sonar signals, the military detects an ancient monster — a MEGALODON, rising fast and ready to strike.

In a moment of desperation, a high-ranking general makes a bold call:
“Release Optimus.”
He personally unlocks Optimus’s restraints and pleads for help.

💥 The battle begins.

The Megalodon attacks, snapping the aircraft carrier in two and sending Optimus plunging into the ocean. A colossal underwater fight breaks out — steel vs tooth, sparks vs tides.

But underwater, Optimus is at a disadvantage. Realizing this, he lures Megalodon to the surface. Now, back on solid ground, Optimus unleashes his true power.

⚔️ One final strike — the monster is defeated.

For the first time, the U.S. military sees Optimus not as a threat…
…but as an ally to mankind.

구텐탁.? 영화보다 재밌는 병맛리뷰 구불입니다. 트랜스모퍼. 킬리킴님, 초보회사원님, 권동환님, troll님, 호오님, Todd님, 피곤한 피카츄님, 2678년에서 온 미래의 인간님, 치즈으님이 요청해주셨습니다. 요청해주셔서 감사드리고.ㅋㅋ 오랜만에 병맛리뷰를 하니까 아 정신을 못차리겠네요.ㅋㅋ 아우 어싸일럼은 언제 봐도 멘탈이 나가는거 같습니다.ㅋㅋ 그래도 구린이들이 요청해주신 영화들 계속해서 리뷰 시도해볼테니까요. 병맛리뷰 늦어서 죄송하고 앞으로 기회 될때마다 찾아뵙도록 하겠습니다.

그리고 이번에 취업을 걱정하시는 기영맘님 @kimtt4101, 이윤정님 @yunjounglee-ns7zk, 진심으로 응원하고요. 기영맘님, 나이가 서른이 넘었다고 초조해하지마시고 좀 늦게 취업하면 어떻습니까. 자신과 맞는 직무로 가는게 더 중요하잖아요. 그게 어떤 사람에겐 10년 20년을 되돌아가야하는 길이거든요. 지금 친구들 취업했다고 조급해서 분별없이 취업한다면 기영맘님의 길을 찾는데 시간이 훨씬 더 걸릴 수가 있습니다. 그리고 지금 친구분들도 취업은 했지만 많은 분들이 같은 고민을 하실 수도 있어요. 그래서 오히려 나에게 맞는 직업을 찾는데 시간을 조금 더 들인다고 생각하시고 쪽팔린다고 친구들 안 만나고 그러지 마세요. 그렇다고 같이 만나서 술만마셔도 안 되지만, 취업한 친구들 이야기도 많이 들어보고 적성에 맞는 분야를 찾는게 당장 취업하는 것보다 훨씬 중요한거 같습니다.

절대 마음 조급하게 먹지 마시고 어느 분야로 갈지 정확히 정하고 그 분야의 실무에 대해서 깊숙히 파악한 상태에서 지원을 하신다면 분명히 좋은 결과 있으시리라 생각이 돼요. 저는 기영맘님 한 6개월 보고 있습니다. 방향만 잘 정하고 집중하시면 6개월 안에는 충분히 자신과 맞는 직종으로 가실 수 있을거라고 확신합니다. 
그래서 두 분 다 힘내시고요. 세상에 이런 영화를 만드는 제작사도 있는데 뭔들 못하겠습니까.?ㅋㅋ 그리고 그걸 또 리뷰 하는 놈이 있어요.ㅋㅋㅋ 아 극한 직업이긴 한데.. 저도 또 제 적성에 맞으니까 하는거겠죠. 이거 안맞으면 절대 못합니다.ㅋㅋ근데 내 적성이 아닐 수도 있어요. 사실 너무 힘들었어.ㅋㅋㅋ/뿅망치 뾱..!

그래도 이런 제작사도 있고 이걸 리뷰하는 놈도 있으니까요. 너무 압박감 갖지 마시고 자신의 적성을 찾았다면 자신감과 여유를 가지고 한번 부딛혀 보는건 어떨까요.? 취업 준비하시는 구린이들 힘내시고요. 저는 다음에 또 기가맥힌 영화리뷰로 다시 찾아뵙겠습니다. 

이상, 트랜스포머 개봉한다고 트랜스모퍼를 만들어버린 미친 제작사의 미친 영화..!/ 제작비를 어디에 쏟아 부어야 할지 정확하게 알고 있는 전설의 영화..!/ 트랜스모퍼였습니다.

구린이들 구꾸까꿍.?

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Sneaky, greedy, money seeking
Always peeping, fucking creeping
Got it on the down low
So you think you always squeaky
What if I had told your mother
Her son was a cruel motherfucker? Ah

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s not just me, it's everybody who thinks that you're fucking ugly
When you come and hurt us just so you can get your money
First to follow the leader was being possessed by demons

[Chorus]
I've tried to make you listen, but you won't, it's your way, right?
Killing kids all day and night, prescription pills and online fights
Shooting at the angels while claiming you're the good guy
All you want is cash and hype
Fuck our dreams and that’s not right

[Post-Chorus]
The principal
Oh, it's the principal
Oh, it's the principal
Oh, it's the principal
Oh, it's the principal
Oh, it's the principal

[Verse 2]
Complicated, overrated
You're fixated, I'm belated
By the separation in this place that you've created
Fuck all of your rules and guidelines
You shouldn’t even be on the sidelines

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't you see that we're all hurtin'?
If you're not teaching, we're not learnin'
Excuse me, how much are you earnin'?

[Chorus]
I've tried to make you listen, but you won't, it's your way, right?
Killing kids all day and night, prescription pills and online fights
Shooting at the angels while claiming you're the good guy
All you want is cash and hype
Fuck our dreams and that’s not right

[Post-Chorus]
The principal
Oh, it's the principal
Oh, it's the principal
Oh, it's the principal
Oh, it's the principal
Oh, it's the principal

[Bridge]
You don't know the pain that you are causing
Yeah, your actions hurt, so do your words
The more you try to fuck us over
We will be there yelling at your front door

[Outro]
I'm trying to make you listen, but you won't, it’s your way, right?

“The Principal” is the third song on Melanie Martinez’s upcoming sophomore album, K-12.

A snippet of the song was released through an interactive game on July 2nd, 2019 and was later posted on Martinez’s accounts with the lyrics. The artwork was made by pastelae, the same artist that made the artwork for “Lunchbox Friends”, “Detention” and “Recess”.

NV3sBlRgzTI,The First Principles Method Explained by Elon Musk,"Interview by Kevin Rose

The benefit of ""first principles"" thinking? It allows you to innovate in clear leaps, rather than building small improvements onto something that already exists. Musk gives an example of the first automobile. While everyone else was trying to improve horse-drawn carriages, someone looked at the fundamentals of transportation and the combustion engine in order to create a car.

Naturally Musk does give one warning about using first principles for innovating however, ""it takes a lot more mental energy.""",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV3sBlRgzTI,2013-12-04,Innomind,UCraozWQb7VkKO5YxtdYOosg,1873872,33966,1371,PT2M49S,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NV3sBlRgzTI/hqdefault.jpg,"elon musk, quotes, The First Principles Method, Tesla Motors (Organization)",28,principle

xguam0TKMw8,Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order by Ray Dalio,"I believe the world is changing in big ways that haven’t happened before in our lifetimes but have many times in history, so I knew I needed to study past changes to understand what is happening now and help me to anticipate what is likely to happen. 

I shared what I learned in my book, Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order, and my hope is that this animation gives people an easy way to understand the key ideas from the book in a simple and entertaining way. In the first 18 minutes, you’ll get the gist of what drives the “Big Cycle” of rise and decline of nations through time and where we now are in that cycle. If you give me 20 minutes more to watch the whole thing, and I will show you how the big cycle worked across the last 500 years of history—and what the current world leading power, the United States, needs to do to remain strong.

I hope you find it valuable and look forward to hearing your thoughts. 

You can buy the book on Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/Changing-World-Order-Nations-Succeed/dp/1982160276/?maas=maas_adg_7DC54053C269F971F2D2F3288B35474D_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas) or in bookstores nationwide.

TQKELOE9eY4,What is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle? - Chad Orzel,"View full lesson: http://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-is-the-heisenberg-uncertainty-principle-chad-orzel

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that you can never simultaneously know the exact position and the exact speed of an object. Why not? Because everything in the universe behaves like both a particle and a wave at the same time. Chad Orzel navigates this complex concept of quantum physics.

The Principle examines how the Copernican principle, the idea that Earth occupies no privileged position in the cosmos, has shaped modern science and whether new cosmological data may challenge it. The film traces a historical line from Ptolemy and Copernicus through Kepler, Newton, Mach, and Einstein, showing how each step moved humanity away from an Earth-centered model toward a relativistic universe in which motion depends on perspective rather than absolute position.

The film presents evidence suggesting this view may be incomplete. Large-scale galaxy redshift surveys reveal periodic shell-like distributions centered near our vantage point. Data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the oldest observable radiation, show anisotropies aligned with the ecliptic and equinoxes, an effect called the Axis of Evil. These alignments were later confirmed by the Planck satellite, increasing questions about whether the universe is truly isotropic.

Two explanations are compared.
First, keep the Copernican framework by using dark matter, dark energy, and cosmic inflation to preserve a uniform model, even though these entities remain unobserved.
Second, relax the Copernican assumption and allow for a special-location model, such as a local cosmic void, that explains observations without dark energy.

The film also considers the philosophical outcome. Rejecting specialness often leads to the multiverse hypothesis, while accepting it reopens discussion of purpose and design. Yet its central focus stays empirical: the anomalies deserve investigation without bias.

In conclusion, The Principle calls for a reevaluation of foundational cosmological assumptions. It argues that genuine science requires openness to every interpretation of data, including the possibility that Earth and humanity may occupy a unique and significant position in the universe.

a8FTr2qMutA,Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle Explained,"Heisenberg's uncertainty principle tells us that it is impossible to simultaneously measure the position and momentum of a particle with infinite precision. In our everyday lives we virtually never come up against this limit, hence why it seems peculiar. In this experiment a laser is shone through a narrow slit onto a screen. As the slit is made narrower, the spot on the screen also becomes narrower. But at a certain point, the spot starts becoming wider. This is because the photons of light have been so localised at the slit that their horizontal momentum must become less well defined in order to satisfy Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

I based this video on one by Prof. Walter Lewin of MIT: http://bit.ly/100Wk2K

Henry (MinutePhysics) has previously made a video about Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle where he treats it as less spooky and more a consequence of waves: http://bit.ly/TV3xO5

Sixty Symbols has a great video on Planck's constant: http://bit.ly/11upebY

Thanks to the University of Sydney for hosting this experiment, especially to Tom and Ralph for their assistance getting it working.

One of the most difficult ideas to swallow in quantum mechanics is Werner Heisenberg’s famous uncertainty principle. It expresses the fundamental limit on the knowability of our universe.  We’ve discussed it in our early videos on quantum mechanics, but it’s time we looked a little deeper. See, the apparent weirdness of the uncertainty principle hints at the even weirder underlying reality that gives rise to it. The universe we experience seems to be constructed of singular particles with well-defined properties. But this intuitive, mechanical reality is emergent from underlying reality in which the particles that form matter arise from of the combination of an infinity of possible properties. And forget matter - the vacuum itself is the sum of infinite possible particles. If we fully unravel this idea we’ll be on the verge of tackling things like Hawking radiation. But as you’ll see today, in that unraveling we are led, unavoidably, to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.
